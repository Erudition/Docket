{-| Create a Moment. A Moment is an `Epoch` and some `Duration` -- the amount of time since that Epoch -- which gives us a globally fixed point in time. You can shift this moment forward or backward by adding other `Duration` values to it.

{-| As _all_ numbers in Javascript are double precision _floating point_ numbers (following the international IEEE 754 standard), that includes its internal representation of time -- yes, this means it will lose accuracy as we move into the future! (Any "integer" over 15 digits loses accuracy, so `9999999999999999 == 10000000000000000`.)

If for some reason you have one of these numbers (`Float` number of milliseconds since the UTC Epoch), this function will turn it into a Moment for you. However, it's more common to use Javascript's `new Date().getTime();`, which means you have an integer instead (in which case just use `moment (Milliseconds intHere) UTCEpoch` to get a moment, or `fromElmTime`.)

{-| Turn an Elm time (from the core `Time` library) into a Moment.

Since 0.19 Elm has a single type for UTC time, called `Posix`. Yet `Posix` isn't a way of telling time, it's a description of how an operating system should work (like Unix and Gnu/Linux). It does mention a standard for representing UTC (which is actually a way of telling time), but that's already got a slightly nicer nickname ("Unix Time") and is _not_ stored as milliseconds since the epoch (like the Elm `Posix`). Rather, it counts _seconds_ since that epoch. (If sub-second accuracy is needed, it is expressed with decimal fractions.)

If you actually want a conversion from "Posix" time (rather than the elm type that bears the name), check out `fromUnixTime`.

fromElmTime int =
    moment (Milliseconds int) UnixEpoch


{-| Turn a Unix time value into a Moment.

On "Unix-like" operating systems, the standard way of keeping time (as defined by a spec called POSIX) is with a single number of _seconds since the epoch_ as defined by the Universal Time standard (UTC) before leap second adjustments. Note that this differs from Elm's inbuilt time library (0.19+), which actually stores _milliseconds_ since the Unix/UTC epoch, despite having a type name of `Posix`. But this library can convert from this faux-Posix time too - check out `fromElmTime`.

Otherwise, use this if you have a real Unix timestamp. This library doesn't have a function named "fromPosix", so we can avoid this ambiguity. Just don't say the functionality wasn't there!

But how do Unix-like systems represent fractions of a second? With the numbers after the decimal point! Therefore, this function accepts a `Float` value. But do note that while your Gnu/Linux machine probably goes all the way down to the microsecond, the smallest Elm can handle is the millisecond - so only three decimal places of your input will be accurately recorded.

{-| A few noteworthy timescales:

  - UT0: An old Universal Time based on looking at things in the sky from labs. The biggest shortcoming is failing to account for the fact that the earth's poles move, but hey, it was early.
  - UT1: This is the principal form of "Universal Time" (ambiguous though that may be), where the idea, as in ages past, is to locate the sun and line up our timekeeping with the solar day. Except it's hard to look at the sun, so we also look at stars and satellites, too. Then we just divide that by 86,400 to figure out how long a second is, since that's how many (60\_60\_24) there are in a day. Great idea in theory, but alas, our solar day speeds up and slows down all the time!
  - UT1R: is a smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic variations due to tides. We didn't like how much it was changing on us...
  - UT2: is another smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic seasonal variations. No one uses it anymore.
  - UTC: Forget moving around with the sun, we want to pick a single length of a second and stick with it! Except we still kinda like having our solar day line up... so let's shoot ourselves in the foot and make the length of a _day_ inconsistent! Yes, UTC is finally synced to the Atomic clock, so it always ticks every SI second. But, a day is not always 84,400 seconds anymore, because at any time there could be a "leap second", all so that we can get back within a second of UT1. Yes, really. Better yet, leap seconds do not even ensure that the sun culminates exactly at 12:00:00.000, as solar noon always deviates from it (up to 16 minutes) over the course of a single year!
  - TAI: Forget all that discontinuous nonsense, for real this time! TAI is just the Atomic clock scale - a pure, linear scale of SI seconds. No leap seconds, no adjustments, no surprises - in the future nor the past. Finally some sanity! UTC is based on atomic time, and would be the same exact scale since 1958 if not for the leap seconds (10 + 27 so far; we only get 6 months' notice on future leaps, some of which may be leaps _backwards_). PTP (Precise Time Protocol) is an uber-precise (sub-microsecond!) standard for distributing time to power grids (PUP accuracy: 1 Î¼s) and such, and it also follows TAI.
  - GMT: Greenwich Mean Time is just the old name for Universal Time, from before 1935, when the term Universal Time was recommended by the International Astronomical Union as a more precise term (because GMT could refer to either an astronomical day starting at noon, or a civil day starting at midnight). But some still use this name for civil time - better to specify UT1 or UTC.
  - GPST: The GPS Time system is 19 seconds behind TAI, and uses a pure linear scale as well - and for good reason, as just one of those leap seconds would cause a location error of up to 460 meters! Currently, GPST is 18 seconds ahead of UTC.
  - TT: Terrestrial Time is exactly 32.184s ahead of TAI for any moment after 1 January 1977 00:00:32.184, when we started applying correction for gravity slowing down/speeding up time (!) based on your elevation. As you may have guessed from the name, TT is often used for talking about timing of objects in space, from the point of view of our terrestrial selves.
